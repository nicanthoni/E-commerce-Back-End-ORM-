## Tech/framework used
* Insomnia, Javascript, Express.js, nodejs,  npm (inquirer, mysql2, dotenv).

## Usage
* In your IDE's integrated terminal, open the Develop folder and login into mysql. Create the database by running 'source ./db/schema,sql'. From there, leave mysql, and seed the data via gitbash by running 'npm run seed'. Be sure to 'npm i' to ensure all necessary dependencies are installed. Now, run 'npm start' to begin testing the routes out in Insomnia. Refer to the 'routes' folder to understand the functionality of each route, and refer to the 'models' folder to understand any associations, as well as table strcutures.
